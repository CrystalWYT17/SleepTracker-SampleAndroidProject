This project is from [Udacity Kotlin Course](https://www.udacity.com/enrollment/ud9012)

The SleepQualityTracker app is a demo app that helps you collect information about your sleep. 
* Start time
* End time
* Quality
* Time slept

This app demonstrates the following views and techniques:
* Room database
* DAO
* Coroutines

It also uses and builds on the following techniques from previous lessons:
* Transformation map
* Data Binding in XML files
* ViewModel Factory
* Using Backing Properties to protect MutableLiveData
* Observable state LiveData variables to trigger navigation

For Coroutines, the library used in this course is **ksp** plugin. You can read more [here](https://developer.android.com/build/migrate-to-ksp).
